[[Coursera Notes]]

- questions where the output, y, can only be 2 values
"binary classification," where false = 0, true = 1. Positive vs negative class (doesn't imply evil or good, rather indicates presence and absence)

sometimes, linear regression can work - however, it is flawed. For example, an outlier can throw off the linear regression line, making it hard to set appropriate boundaries at which classifications are made
