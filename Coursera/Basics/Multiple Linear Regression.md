Multiple features in linear regression, not to be confused with multivariate regression
$x_j$ = $j^{th}$ feature
$n =$ number of features
$x^i$ = features of the $i^{th}$ training example <- a vector
$x^i_j$ = value of feature j in training example i

**Model:**
$f_{w,b}(x) = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3 + w_4 x_4 + b$
$\vec{w}$ = vector of weights
$\vec{x}$ = vector of inputs
thus,
$f_{\vec{w}, x} = \vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} + b$

**Implementation:**
[[Vectorization]]
[[Gradient Descent for Multiple Linear Regression]]
[[Feature Scaling]]
