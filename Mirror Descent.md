- basically, transforming a cost function u cant find the derivative for into a monotonically decreasing utillity function that goes from 1 (no cost) to approaching 0 (max cost)

*cross entropy method?*
- given samples, what has max utility
- use samples to redo policy
- the threshold used in the indicator is dynamic?

*KL divergence for bregman divergence?*

*KL divergence and exponential family*
natural params -> reverse KL
expectation params -> normal/forward(?) KL

What even is a divergence -> $D_h = KL(\pi_\theta || \pi_{\theta})$
^second theta should have tilde on top

*element wise division?*
