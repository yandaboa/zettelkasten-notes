might be able to find content online
- commit from beginning to research
- research in diff areas -> broad view
- basic research skills
- asking Qs
- teaches time management
- summer opportunities for research might be overlooked/a lot of graduate school admits do this
- incentive structures in research - tax money -> NSF -> PIs, who's paid by what
- Peer review as well, central to research <- who does reviews?
- recommendation letters come from professors in the lab

- 390R teaches all of these things that otherwise gain from exposure

attributes:
- curiosity & creativity
- good communication
- writing well
- good presentations

Autumn
- research night, where all labs have a representative
Winter
- getting into research night/event
Spring
- showcase, where people present their research

- cold email professors/grad students, feel free to do it more than once
- 590 - special topics seminars
	- one is a speaker series <- robotics colloqium?
		- just show up, get good sampling of what good research projects there are
		- professors and graduates go, can meet them there
	- reading group
		- every week there's a paper, someone in charge of presenting it
		- can get pointed in directions for how to understand papers
- Summer research - REUs
	- NSF -> entire chunk for REUs
	- Most only for US citizens
	- paid <- doesn't really compare with internships
	- Applications processes
	- 390R can help with applications to these/getting rec letters
	- a single REU experience can get you into graduate school!

GRE
- some faculty still look at it as a signal of strong performance
- can take it over and over if you can pay
- still considered for international applicants
- UW tries to ignore GRE scores as much as possible

- graduate school applications start early in december, start preparing early

students change directions a bit, but usually don't switch areas completely

- graduate school application is split into huddles by topic
- sometimes skills match more with another huddle
- usually you have to select the bin you're in! maximize your chances of admittance

For some countries, Turkey, masters -> PHD. Here, you choose between masters and PHD.
- masters - specialize in a topic as quickly as possible -> find a more specialized job in industry
- very hard to get scholarships for masters <- PIs prefer to pay PHDs rather than paying masters
- masters students usually aren't there as long/no guarantee
- "mastering out" - if your PHD is not working out, you can leave with a masters at the very least
- applications for masters is much lighter - dont have to talk as much about research experience, just need to do well in classes

BS/MS
- 10% want to teach, MS required to teach here
- 80% want to get a job afterwards
- 10% research track - might not be completely ready for applications, or are aiming really high - CMU/Stanford/Berkeley
- BS/MS doesn't really have a formalized preference for which kind of student they want to see - but it does show up clearly during discussions
- for those that want to do research - articulate what classes they want to take, they are working with a lab, and the admissions wants to see that their professor wants to keep working with them.

Award applications
- youre not eligible if you're a masters student
- BS/MS can hurt the pool of eligible candidates

Going to seminars can be a good way to getting a look at what the research in the area looks like
Affiliates research day - affiliates come in, close to graduation students come in for presentation
poster sessions throughout the year

No undergraduate research in Turkey, intimidating to show up at a lab
- applied for mechatronics minor, one of the courses needed was a lab building robots -> TA recommended to research lab in CE department
- charging the robot
- being at the right place at the right time!
- masters -> research was preferable to recruiting and going into work force

Challenges and adversarial conditions
- perseverance is very important!
- when frustration comes up, how do you find an alternative way? Do you persist
	- great point to show creativity!

HCI Lab
- narrowed down to assistive robotics, helping those who are paralyzed program and control the robot to do things
- partnering with community to try and bring robots to homes
- slowly adding autonomy -> taking a human led/demonstrated action, getting it into autonomous form
	- might still mean a person is still involved somewhere in the loop
- how to verify the robot is being safe

Motivation
- don't want to burn out! work on work-life balance
- people impact -> motivating for researchers working on these robots
- how to get insurance to cover the robot? insurance is only for medical necessity
	- maybe saying robot prevents depression? loophole?
- for others, process itself is motivating â€” being able to work on it
- some, motivated by the challenge, trying to prove someone/something wrong

What causes someone to not do well in research?
- when applying to grad school and dont get in, more about getting the right fit
- challenging in research:
	- if youre too used to external rewards, goals being set for you, research is not like that. No more assignments/reminders, etc.
	- ADHD - seeking the right accommodations and telling professors
	- access computing works on increasing the ease of those with ADHD
- asking for recommendation letters - blog post. Who, what, when, where, why.
	- soft skills matter a lot too - those you TA could write one
